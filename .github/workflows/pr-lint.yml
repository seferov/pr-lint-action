# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch

  pull_request:
    types: ["opened", "edited", "reopened", "synchronize"]
  # push:
  #   branches: [ master ]
  # pull_request:
  #   branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job

      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
